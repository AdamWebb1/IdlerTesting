It can be used to increase playing time or to earn trading cards, it can't be used to get Team Fortress 2 or Dota 2 items!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nAfter you have compiled SteamIdler, you can use the program with the following command-line arguments.\r\n\r\n``SteamIdler.exe <SteamUsername> <SteamPassword> <AppID> [AppID] [...]``\r\n\r\nIf compiled with Mono, SteamIdler can also be used in Linux.\r\n\r\n## Final Note\r\nThis probably isn't a good idea to use, if you're after getting cards since Steam's latest update, still works for adding hours to Steam Games however..\r\n",
