SteamIdler (**Need to add SteamGuard Support**)
==========

# SteamIdler


SteamIdler allows you to appear as 'in-game' without having Steam open. It can be used to increase playing time or to earn trading cards, it can't be used to get Team Fortress 2 or Dota 2 items!


## Usage

After you have compiled SteamIdler, you can use the program with the following command-line arguments.

``SteamIdler.exe <SteamUsername> <SteamPassword> <AppID> [AppID] [...]``

If compiled with Mono, SteamIdler can also be used in Linux.
